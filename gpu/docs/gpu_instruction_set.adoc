| Bit 1 | Bit 2 | Bit 3 | Bit 4 | Bits 5-12  | Bits 13-16 | Bits 17-80

== Bit Field Definitions

=== Bit 1: Scalar/Vector Mode (SV)
* `0` = Scalar operation
* `1` = Vector operation

=== Bit 2: Write to Memory (WRT)  
* `0` = No memory write
* `1` = Writes to memory

=== Bit 3: Read from Memory (RD)
* `0` = No memory read (use immediate data only)
* `1` = Reads from memory

=== Bit 4: Amount of Values Read (VAL)
[NOTE]
====
Only valid if bit 3 (RD) = 1
====

* `0` = Read 1 value from memory
* `1` = Read 2 values from memory

=== Bits 5-12: Instruction Opcode
4 bits providing *16 possible instructions* (0000-1111)

=== Bits 13-16: Destination Register
4 bits providing the register to output the data computed, including write pointers
[NOTE]
====
Only ignored when writing data to memory, of which bits 13-16 shall be nulled/0
====

== Data Field (64 bits)

The 64-bit data field contains **all data** needed for the instruction:

* Memory addresses/pointers
* Immediate values  
* Operands
* Mixed data types as needed

== Architecture Notes

[IMPORTANT]
====
* No trinary opcodes allowed as of this moment
* Data field interpretation depends on the instruction flags
* Pointer sizes may vary based on architecture requirements, will be defined at a later date
